A simple, clean, and responsive CV builder built with **React** and **Vite** as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

This app allows users to fill in their personal information, education, and work experience, then toggle between an editable form view and a beautifully formatted preview that resembles a real resume.

## Features

- Single-page application with global **Edit / Preview** toggle
- Three main sections:
  - General Information (Name, Email, Phone)
  - Educational Experience
  - Practical Experience (with responsibilities)
- Controlled inputs — data updates live as you type
